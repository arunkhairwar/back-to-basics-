**Description:**

_"Back to Basics" is a dedicated space for my fundamental projects as I revisit and strengthen my JavaScript and web development skills. This repository showcases a range of small projects, including to-do lists, weather apps, mini-games, landing pages, and more. Each project represents my commitment to mastering the basics and building a solid foundation in javascript._

**Goals:**

1. Hands-On Learning:
Reinforce my understanding of core HTML, CSS, and JavaScript concepts by building practical, small-scale projects.

2. Skill Improvement:
  Focus on key areas like DOM manipulation, API integration, responsive design, and game logic to improve my coding skills.

3. Track Progress:
  Document my journey of continuous learning and improvement as I address gaps in my understanding and refine my approach.

**Projects Include:**

* To-do List: DOM manipulation and event handling
  
* Weather App: Fetching data from APIs
  
* Mini-Games: Simple game logic and interactivity

And more as I explore and build!

Why "Back to Basics"? After recognizing my inconsistent learning approach, I created this repository to focus on consistent practice and skill enhancement. It‚Äôs about learning by doing, embracing challenges, and continuously improving through hands-on projects.
